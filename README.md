Movie AI Query ðŸŽ¬
Movie AI Query is a Python-based project that leverages Googleâ€™s Generative AI API to answer movie-related questions.
By using cutting-edge AI models, this project allows users to query for things like "Which is the best movie of 2022?" and get an intelligent, text-based response based on the AI's knowledge.

FEATURES :
AI-Powered Movie Responses: Get insights or recommendations for movies based on your queries.
Customizable AI Generation: Adjust parameters such as temperature and max_output_tokens to control the response style and length.
Easy Setup: Simple installation and usage with just a few steps.

PREREQUISITES :
Python 3.x
Google Generative AI API key

INSTALLATION: 
> Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-ai-query.git
cd movie-ai-query
>Install Dependencies: Install the required Python package:
pip install google-generativeai
CONFIGURATION : 
To use the Google Generative AI API, you need to configure your API key. Make sure to replace the placeholder API key in the code with your own.
genai.configure(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE")

USAGE :
To generate movie-related responses, run the Python script:
python movie_ai_query.py
Example query:
text = "Which is the best movie of 2022?"
Once the script runs, the AI will generate a response based on the given prompt.

CUSTOMIZATION:
You can adjust the following parameters to fine-tune the AI response:
>temperature: Controls the randomness/creativity of the response (higher values mean more creative outputs).
>max_output_tokens: Controls the maximum length of the response.
Example Output
The best movie of 2022 was widely considered to be 'Everything Everywhere All at Once' based on critical acclaim and awards.
